# arduino-car
a creative RC car build tutorial

## Components:

- Servo
- DC Motor
- Battery Holder for 4 AA Batteries
- 4 AA Batteries
- Arduino Nano
- Piezo Buzzer
- IR Receiver
- IR Remote
- Some sort of gear arrangement to connect motor power to the axle
- Breadboard

## Materials: 
- Straws (I used plastic)
- Tape (I used painter's for easy maintenance)
- Wooden Skewers
- 3 Wheels
- Hot Glue Gun w/ sticks

## How To:
1. Get creative with it! Build the body or chasis of your car with your structural material and glue on a straw to act as the rear axle.
2. Put a skewer inside of the straw and connect the wheels and gear to this.

Here is a diagram where [] is a wheel, - is the skewer, = is the straw, and :: is the gear. <br>
[]-=====-::-[] 

3. Glue another gear to the end of the motor's shaft and fix that in a way that both gears connect.
4. Set up and attach the breadboard with the Arduino and components as documented in the code.
5. Have fun with your new, handmade RC car!
